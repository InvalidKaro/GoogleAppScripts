App script ideas for google forms and more



## How to Script with Google
1. Getting Started with Google Apps Script

- Open a web browser and go to the Google Apps Script website: https://script.google.com.
- Click on the "Start Scripting" button to open the Apps Script editor. 
OR:
- Open your Google project, such as the Google Form, Google Doc, or Google Sheet.
- From the menu, select "Tools" and then choose "Script editor".
- This will open the Apps Script editor for that specific project.

2. Writing Your First Code

- In the Apps Script editor, you'll see a default Code.gs file.
- You can start writing your code in the Code.gs file.
- Google Apps Script uses JavaScript as the programming language, so you can write JavaScript code directly in the editor.
- Write your desired code logic, functions, or customizations in the Code.gs file.

3. Triggers

Triggers allow you to automate the execution of your code at specific times or events.

- To create a trigger, click on the "Triggers" icon (clock-shaped) in the Apps Script editor toolbar.
- Click on the "+ Add Trigger" button to create a new trigger.
- Choose the function you want to trigger and specify the event or time-based condition for triggering.
- Save the trigger settings.

4. Deploying Your Script

Deploying your script makes it available to be used or accessed.

- In the Apps Script editor, click on the "Deploy" menu.
- Select "New Deployment" to create a new deployment.
- Choose the type of deployment you want (Web app, API executable, Add-on, etc.).
- Configure the deployment settings, such as access permissions, version, and deployment description.
- Click on the "Deploy" button to deploy your script.
- You'll receive a deployment URL that can be shared or accessed.
